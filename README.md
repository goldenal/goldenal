 Hello, I am Adewale ðŸ‘‹!Iâ€™m a results-driven engineer passionate about building scalable, user-centric products that deliver measurable growth and impact.

At Vesti, I led the mobile engineering team and scaled the app from 5,000 to 1M+ downloads in 3 years, driving innovation in fintech security, scalability, and user experience. My focus goes beyond writing clean codeâ€”I specialize in optimizing user journeys, integrating backend systems, and delivering products that boost engagement, retention, and revenue.

With expertise across Flutter, NestJS, Node.js, and Python, I design and deploy robust backend architectures, APIs, and real-time systems that seamlessly power mobile experiences. This end-to-end skill set enables me to bridge the gap between mobile and backend, ensuring products are both delightful and resilient.

I thrive in fast-paced, cross-functional environments, where I bring a mix of technical leadership, mentoring, and problem-solving to deliver high-impact software at scale.
